- [x] [Drawing Routes with Polyline](https://github.com/Kalebu/Folium-visualization-examples/tree/main/drawing-route)


## Adding Image Marker to Folium Maps

In this example you learn how to develop interactive maps with image marker + descriptions just as shown in the example output below;

![Tanzania Map](image-marker/image-marker-example.png)

## Drawing Routes

Folium Polyline can help you draw routes between points but just making a straightline through them just as shown below, which can be of least use in our dailycase where we are more interested on the real routes such as (driver route, walk route, and ..) but there cases you may need it .

For incase you're interested on drawing those routes which ofcouse you're , you might wanna take alook at these library and Examples they help you  do that with python;

- [Networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) + [Osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)
- [Here examples on how to that](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/main/notebooks/11-plot-routes-folium-web-map.ipynb)
